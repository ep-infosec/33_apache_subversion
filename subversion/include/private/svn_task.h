/**
 * A task is a "unit of work", basically a glorified function call.
 * It shall not be confused with "thread".
 *
 * During execution, a task may add further sub-tasks - equivalent to
 * sub-function calls.  They will be executed after their parent task
 * has been processed forming a growing tree of *isolated* tasks.
 *
 * Tasks may be executed in arbitrary order, concurrently and in parallel.
 * To guarantee consistent output order and error handling, every task
 * consists of two functions.  The first is the "process function" that
 * should perform the bulk of the work, may be executed in some worker
 * thread and may produce some result.
 * 
 * The latter is later passed into the second function, the "output function".
 * This one is called in the main thread and strictly in post-order wrt.
 * the position of the respective task within the tree.  However, a task
 * may produce output that needs to be processed before any sub-task or
 * in between them - just like you would in normal function / sub-function
 * code.  Such partial outputs can be handed in whenever a new sub-task
 * is being added and the output function will be called on them right
 * before handling the output of the respective sub-task.
 * 
 * Both, process and output functions, may add further sub-tasks as needed.
 * 
 * Errors are detected in strictly in post-order, with only the first one
 * being returned from the task runner.  In particular, it may not be the
 * first error that occurs timewise but only the first one encountered when
 * walking the tree and checking the processing results for errors.  Because
 * it takes some time to make the workers cancel all outstanding tasks,
 * additional errors may occur before and after the one that ultimately
 * gets reported.  All those errors are being swallowed.
 *
 * Since tasks may be executed by worker threads, we need a way to set up
 * an appropriate environment for that thread to meet the single-threaded
 * execution assumed by SVN and APR APIs.  This environment is called
 * "thread context" and could be something like a svn_wc__db_t.
 *
 * Any of the functions may be NULL.  Process function and output function
 * may differ from task to task while the thread context constructor has
 * to be shared.
 *
 * The task runner will take care of creating pools with appropriate
 * lifetime and threading settings but the functions called may not make
 * any assumptions about them beyond that.  In particular, you cannot share
 * data that was allocated in those pools between tasks.
